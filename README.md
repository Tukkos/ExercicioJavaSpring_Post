# Java Spring exercise

This repository is an study on Spring Framework using Java. To practice post method and DTO creation, I`ve decided to create an simple post controller that accepts car entry with this format:

{
	"modelo": String,
	"fabricante": String,
	"dataFabricacao": String,
	"valor": int,
	"anoModelo": int,
}
